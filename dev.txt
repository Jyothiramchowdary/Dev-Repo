What is & Why version control system ?
=============================================================================
What is version control system ? Managing some unique version or Unique ids via commit_ids in form of Hexa decimal code using SHA mechansim ( Secure hashing Algorithm - 256 bits).


Why version control system ?

1. Tracking: We can get the details like  - who modified: user_name and email
                                            Modified date & time of the user_name
                                            Size : Size in GB/MB/KB
                                            We can get details like Which line/word/sentence/paragraph was modified/added/deleted/appended.


2. Storage Optimization:  

Let suppose, Developer is working on login-feature of website.

DAY-1: Login-feature.java -> 1 GB Data -> compliation,execution,testing etc -> Working file -> Stable.
    VCS says -> Record your changes with commit_id - Hexa Demical code -> 3NINCNCCNCNSACSACC59 -> SHA( Secure hashing Algorithm - 256 bits)
DAY-2: Login-feature.java -> 5 GB Data -> compliation,execution,testing etc  -> Working file -> Stable.
          VCS says -> Record your changes with commit_id - Hexa Demical code -> Xkdj9hr932r1bno9n9o223
DAY-3: Login-feature.java -> 5 GB Data -> compliation,execution,testing etc  -> Working file -> Stable.
          VCS says -> Record your changes with commit_id - Hexa Demical code -> ncnqwdhhinn234RNLKQCR33
