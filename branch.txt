The repository in the above diagram indicates a central server that could be local or remote which is
directly connected to each of the programmer’s workstation.
Every programmer can extract or update their workstations with the data present in the repository or
can make changes to the data or commit in the repository. Every operation is performed directly on the
repository.
Even though it seems pretty convenient to maintain a single repository, it has some major drawbacks.
Some of them are:
• It is not locally available; meaning you always need to be connected to a network to perform any
action.
• Since everything is centralized, in any case of the central server getting crashed or corrupted will
result in losing the entire data of the project.
This is when Distributed VCS comes to the rescue.
