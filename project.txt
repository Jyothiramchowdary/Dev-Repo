GIT - Global Tracking System

Introduction to Git
In professional development environments, the code is written in teams of developers. From your
colleague sitting around the corner to a remote developer living across the globe, anyone could be writing
code with you and contributing to the same codebase. The best and most popular way to contribute code
to a single codebase is Version Control Systems.
What's Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). "Distributed" means that all developers within a team
have a complete version of the project. A version control system is simply software that lets you
effectively manage application versions. Thanks to Git, you'll be able to do the following:
• Keep track of all files in a project
• Record any changes to project files
• Restore previous versions of files
• Compare and analyze code
• Merge code from different computers and different team members.
Version Control Systems:
Version control systems are systems that allow us to contribute to and manage different releases and
stages of a software product without actually having to keep multiple files or folders. They also make
development within a team more manageable and less of a pain as developers don’t have to be trading
folders, but rather communicate with a single source where all the changes are happening and everything
is saved.
There are two types of Version Control Systems: Centralized and Distributed.
1. Centralized Version Control Systems
Centralized means that the codebase or the project resides in one central place also known as a repository.
In order to make changes, people need to have access to that repository and write their code in it.
Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files and enables team
collaboration. It works on a single repository to which users can directly access a central server.
